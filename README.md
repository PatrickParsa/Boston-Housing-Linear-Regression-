# Boston-Housing-Linear-Regression-

## Summary

## Context

Our task is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. Meanwhile, we also want to identify the most important features in the dataset. To achieve this, we apply different techniques of preprocessing and then we build a linear regression model to predict the prices for us. 

## Technologies Used

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels
* ProbPlot (from statsmodels)
* ols 
* Sklearn
* LinearRegression
